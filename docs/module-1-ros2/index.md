# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the middleware for robotic control, providing a communication framework that allows different components of a robotic system to interact seamlessly. Think of ROS 2 as the nervous system of a robot, enabling coordinated action between sensors, controllers, and actuators.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 as middleware for robotic control
- Identify and explain the core communication patterns: Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
- Recognize how Python agents can bridge to ROS 2 controllers using rclpy
- Understand the role of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) in humanoid robot description

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:
1. [ROS 2 Middleware Concepts](./middleware.md) - Understanding the role of ROS 2 in robotic systems
2. [Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions](./nodes-topics-services-actions.md) - Core communication patterns in ROS 2
3. [Python Agents Bridging to ROS 2](./python-agents.md) - Using rclpy to create Python-based ROS 2 nodes
4. [URDF Overview](./urdf-overview.md) - Robot description and modeling with URDF
5. [Learning Outcomes](./learning-outcomes.md) - Summary of key concepts and skills

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line operations
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts

## Estimated Time

This module should take approximately 4-6 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with robotics frameworks.

## Why ROS 2 Matters

ROS 2 is critical to modern robotics because it:
- Provides a standardized communication framework
- Enables code reusability across different robotic platforms
- Offers a rich ecosystem of tools and packages
- Supports real-time and safety-critical applications
- Facilitates collaboration between different robotic components

In the next section, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 as middleware and how it serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems.
