## Prompt

Technical Specification for Physical AI Book (Iteration 2)

Goal of this iteration:
Transform the completed high-level book structure into a fully implementable Docusaurus project hosted on GitHub Pages. This iteration focuses on site architecture, deployment, authentication, personalization, Urdu translation, and automation using Context7 MCP Servers.

Pre-installed environment:
- Project scaffold created via: npx create-docusaurus@latest docu-init classic
- Template src and static files moved from 'docu-init' into project root
- Extra templates in 'docu-init' removed
- NPM packages already installed:
- better-auth
- better-sqlite3
- All default files generated by the Docusaurus Classic template must be modified or replaced to match our custom book requirements.

Target output:
A detailed technical specification defining Docusaurus structure, navigation, content placement, GitHub Pages deployment, better-auth integration, and MCP server automation.

Focus:
1. Docusaurus site architecture + restructuring of template-generated files
2. GitHub Pages deployment workflow (CI/CD)
3. better-auth + better-sqlite3 setup for protected author/admin areas
4. Adding user signup questionnaire for background profiling
5. Adding per-chapter personalization and Urdu translation toggles
6. Integration of Context7 MCP servers for automated content generation
7. Alignment with Docusaurus official docs: https://docusaurus.io/docs


Success criteria:
- Docusaurus folder structure correctly reorganized to reflect the four modules of the Physical AI book
- GitHub Pages CI/CD pipeline fully functional
- better-auth integrated for login, signup, logout, and gated author content
- Signup flow collects user software/hardware background
- Personalize-chapter button modifies chapter content based on stored profile
- Urdu-translation button swaps English MDX with auto-generated Urdu MDX
- MCP workflows implemented for scaffolding, Urdu generation, sidebar extraction, and MDX validation
- Build passes with `npm run build` and works correctly on GitHub Pages
- Public and author-only content strictly separated
- Context7 MCP servers used for file generation, linting, and consistency checks
- All changes validated with Docusaurus build, auth tests, and deployment tests

Constraints:
- Output format: Markdown/MDX documentation
- Styling: Docusaurus Classic Theme + custom CSS
- Hosting target: GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch)
- better-auth must operate entirely in static-hosted mode (no backend)
- better-sqlite3 used only for local author env, not client-side bundle
- No backend API routes
- No additional custom plugins beyond official Docusaurus + required wrappers
- Urdu translation must be static (no runtime translation API)
- MCP must handle all automated generation and structural consistency checks
- Public docs and restricted author zone must remain strictly separated

Timeline (7–10 days total):
- Days 1–2: Template restructuring + architecture cleanup
- Day 3: GitHub Pages deployment setup
- Days 4–5: Authentication (login, signup, guard logic, SQLite author mode)
- Day 6: Personalization + Urdu translation components
- Day 7: MCP automation setup (scaffolding, translation, validation)
- Days 8–10: Testing, polishing, and final integration

Not building:
- No custom Docusaurus plugins beyond official + required auth wrappers
- No backend server or API routes
- No multi-user identity systems (SSO, OAuth, enterprise auth)
- No ROS/robotics code execution—content only
- No alternative hosting (Vercel, Netlify)
- No live translation APIs

## Response snapshot

Successfully created a comprehensive specification for the Physical AI Book (Iteration 2) feature. The specification includes:

1. Four prioritized user stories covering core functionality:
   - Access to Physical AI book content (P1)
   - Personalized learning experience (P2)
   - Urdu translation capability (P3)
   - Author/admin content access (P2)

2. Ten functional requirements covering:
   - Content organization and structure
   - Authentication and user profiling
   - Personalization features
   - Translation capabilities
   - Deployment and validation workflows

3. Key entities identified:
   - User Profile
   - Book Module
   - Chapter Content
   - Translation Pair
   - Access Level

4. Ten measurable success criteria aligned with the original requirements

5. A quality checklist for validation at specs/2-physical-ai-book-iteration2/checklists/requirements.md

The specification addresses the core goals of transforming the high-level book structure into a fully implementable Docusaurus project with authentication, personalization, and translation features.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification created for Physical AI Book Iteration 2 with implementation focus
- 🧪 Tests: Specification completeness validated with checklist
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements checklist created in specs/2-physical-ai-book-iteration2/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for clarification (/sp.clarify) and planning (/sp.plan) phases
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created implementation-focused specification with proper user stories and measurable criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: PowerShell script execution failed, required manual file creation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification meets quality criteria
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to clarification phase to resolve any remaining ambiguities
