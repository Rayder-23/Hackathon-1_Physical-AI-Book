# Feature Specification: Physical AI Book (Iteration 2)

**Feature Branch**: `2-physical-ai-book-iteration2`
**Created**: 2025-12-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Technical Specification for Physical AI Book (Iteration 2)

Goal of this iteration:
Transform the completed high-level book structure into a fully implementable Docusaurus project hosted on GitHub Pages. This iteration focuses on site architecture, deployment, authentication, personalization, Urdu translation, and automation using Context7 MCP Servers.

Pre-installed environment:
- Project scaffold created via: npx create-docusaurus@latest docu-init classic
- Template src and static files moved from 'docu-init' into project root
- Extra templates in 'docu-init' removed
- NPM packages already installed:
- better-auth
- better-sqlite3
- All default files generated by the Docusaurus Classic template must be modified or replaced to match our custom book requirements.

Target output:
A detailed technical specification defining Docusaurus structure, navigation, content placement, GitHub Pages deployment, better-auth integration, and MCP server automation.

Focus:
1. Docusaurus site architecture + restructuring of template-generated files
2. GitHub Pages deployment workflow (CI/CD)
3. better-auth + better-sqlite3 setup for protected author/admin areas
4. Adding user signup questionnaire for background profiling
5. Adding per-chapter personalization and Urdu translation toggles
6. Integration of Context7 MCP servers for automated content generation
7. Alignment with Docusaurus official docs: https://docusaurus.io/docs"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-08

- Q: What are the specific security and privacy requirements for user data and authentication? → A: Basic authentication with standard security practices appropriate for educational content
- Q: What are the expected performance requirements for the Physical AI Book platform? → A: Standard web performance (pages load in under 3 seconds) appropriate for educational content
- Q: What are the expected scale requirements for users and content in the Physical AI Book platform? → A: Minimal scale (dozens of users) for a small, focused audience
- Q: How sophisticated should the personalization be and what criteria should trigger content modifications? → A: Basic personalization based on user's software/hardware background to show relevant examples and depth level
- Q: How should the Urdu translation feature be implemented and what should happen when content isn't available in Urdu? → A: Pre-generated translations with fallback to English when Urdu content is unavailable


## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Physical AI Book Content (Priority: P1)

As a learner interested in Physical AI and humanoid robotics, I want to access a well-structured book with modules on ROS 2, Simulation, Isaac AI, and Vision-Language-Action systems so that I can understand the complete pipeline from voice command to robotic action.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the book - providing comprehensive, accessible content on Physical AI that follows the complete pipeline from voice command to robotic action.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the book through a web browser and navigating through the four modules, delivering immediate educational value to users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a visitor to the Physical AI book website, **When** I access the site, **Then** I can navigate through the four modules of the book (ROS 2, Simulation, Isaac AI, VLA)
2. **Given** I am on the book homepage, **When** I click on a module, **Then** I can read the content and follow the learning path in a structured manner

---

### User Story 2 - Personalize Learning Experience (Priority: P2)

As a learner with specific software/hardware background, I want to personalize my learning experience by answering a questionnaire and toggling chapter content so that the material is tailored to my skill level and interests.

**Why this priority**: Personalization significantly enhances the learning experience by adapting content to the user's background and needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing the signup questionnaire and using the personalization toggle to modify chapter content, delivering a customized learning experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new user visiting the book, **When** I complete the signup questionnaire about my software/hardware background, **Then** my profile is stored and used to personalize content
2. **Given** I am viewing a chapter, **When** I click the personalization toggle, **Then** the content is modified based on my stored profile

---

### User Story 3 - Access Content in Urdu Translation (Priority: P3)

As a Urdu-speaking learner, I want to access the Physical AI book content in Urdu so that I can better understand the concepts in my native language.

**Why this priority**: Expanding accessibility to Urdu speakers broadens the book's reach and impact in regions where Urdu is commonly spoken.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using the Urdu translation toggle to switch between English and Urdu content, delivering multilingual accessibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am viewing a chapter in English, **When** I click the Urdu translation toggle, **Then** the content switches to Urdu equivalent
2. **Given** I am viewing a chapter in Urdu, **When** I click the English translation toggle, **Then** the content switches back to English

---

### User Story 4 - Access Author/Admin Content (Priority: P2)

As an author or administrator, I want to access protected content areas so that I can manage and contribute to the book while keeping certain content separate from public access.

**Why this priority**: Maintaining separate author/admin areas ensures content quality and allows for collaborative development of the book.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and accessing the protected author areas, delivering secure content management capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an authenticated author, **When** I attempt to access protected content, **Then** I am granted access to the author/admin areas
2. **Given** I am an unauthenticated user, **When** I attempt to access protected content, **Then** I am redirected to the login page

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to access the Urdu translation of a chapter that hasn't been translated yet?
- How does the system handle authentication failures when accessing protected content?
- What occurs when the MCP server automation fails during content generation?
- How does the system respond when GitHub Pages deployment fails?
