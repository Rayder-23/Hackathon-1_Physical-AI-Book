# Style Guide and Formatting Standards for Authors

## Writing Style and Voice

### Tone and Approach
- Maintain a professional yet approachable tone that encourages learning
- Use active voice predominantly for clarity and engagement
- Write with empathy for the learner's journey and potential challenges
- Balance technical precision with accessibility for the target audience

### Language Standards
- Use consistent terminology throughout all content
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Write for the specified audience level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Use inclusive language that welcomes diverse backgrounds and experiences
- Avoid idioms or culturally specific references that may not translate globally

### Content Flow
- Create smooth transitions between concepts and sections
- Use parallel structure for lists and similar elements
- Maintain consistent voice and perspective throughout each module
- Build complexity gradually from foundational to advanced concepts

## Formatting and Structure

### Heading Hierarchy
- H1: Module or major section titles (only one per document)
- H2: Major subsections within modules
- H3: Detailed topics or concepts
- H4: Specific procedures or subtopics (use sparingly)
- Maintain logical progression without skipping heading levels

### Text Formatting
- Use bold for emphasis and key terms on first introduction
- Use italics sparingly for book titles, foreign terms, or subtle emphasis
- Use code formatting (`single backticks`) for inline code, filenames, and technical terms
- Use code blocks (```fenced blocks```) for multi-line code examples

### Lists and Organization
- Use ordered lists for sequential steps or processes
- Use unordered lists for related items without specific order
- Maintain parallel structure within list items (similar grammatical form)
- Limit list items to one main idea each for clarity

## Technical Documentation Standards

### Code Examples
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting for the language
- Include comments explaining complex or non-obvious code sections
- Provide complete, runnable examples when possible
- Use consistent naming conventions and indentation
- Include error handling where appropriate for production use

### Images and Media
- Include descriptive alt text for all images (minimum 10 words, maximum 120 characters)
- Use consistent file naming conventions: `module-topic-description.ext`
- Provide captions for complex diagrams explaining key elements
- Ensure images are high enough resolution for clarity while optimizing file size
- Use captions to explain the significance of visual elements

### Links and References
- Use descriptive link text instead of generic phrases like "click here"
- Open external links in new tabs when appropriate
- Include the source or reference for any external information
- Use consistent formatting for internal vs. external links

## Content-Specific Guidelines

### Physical AI and Robotics Content
- Use consistent abbreviations: ROS 2 (not ROS2), NVIDIA Isaac (not Isaac), etc.
- Define acronyms on first use within each module
- Use metric units as the primary measurement system
- Include both theoretical concepts and practical implementation approaches

### Mathematical and Technical Notation
- Use proper mathematical notation in context-appropriate ways
- Define variables and symbols when first introduced
- Use consistent notation throughout related content
- Provide explanations for complex mathematical concepts in accessible terms

### Cross-Module Consistency
- Maintain consistent terminology across all modules
- Use the same example scenarios when illustrating similar concepts
- Reference other modules appropriately when building on previous concepts
- Ensure examples scale appropriately from basic to advanced applications

## Accessibility Standards

### Inclusive Design
- Write alternative text for all visual content
- Use sufficient color contrast for readability
- Provide text alternatives for audio/visual content
- Structure content for screen reader compatibility

### Multiple Learning Styles
- Include visual diagrams alongside textual explanations
- Provide both conceptual overviews and detailed procedures
- Use consistent navigation and organization patterns
- Offer multiple ways to engage with the same material
