# Introduction: What is Physical AI? Embodied Intelligence Basics

## Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to Physical AI and humanoid robotics, designed for students, educators, and practitioners entering this exciting field. Physical AI represents the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, where intelligence is embodied in machines that interact with the real world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI, also known as embodied AI, refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and learn from physical environments. Unlike traditional AI that processes abstract data, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of real-world physics, sensorimotor coordination, and environmental dynamics.

Key characteristics of Physical AI include:
- **Embodiment**: Intelligence is grounded in physical form and interaction
- **Real-time Processing**: Systems must respond to dynamic environments
- **Sensorimotor Integration**: Perception and action are tightly coupled
- **Physics Awareness**: Systems must understand and work within physical constraints

## The Four Pillars of Modern Physical AI Systems

This book is structured around four core technologies that form the foundation of modern humanoid robotics:

1. **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: The middleware that enables communication between different components of a robotic system
2. **Simulation**: Digital twins that allow safe testing and training of robotic systems
3. **AI Control Systems**: The intelligence layer that makes decisions and plans actions
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: The cognitive interface that enables natural interaction with robots

## Who Should Read This Book?

This book is designed for three primary audiences:

- **Students**: Those entering the field of Physical AI, robotics simulation, and humanoid control
- **Educators**: Those preparing robotics/AI curriculum for academic settings
- **Practitioners**: Beginners and intermediates learning ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, and VLA systems

## Learning Approach

The book follows a progressive learning path:
- Start with fundamental concepts before moving to complex implementations
- Understand the theoretical foundations before diving into practical applications
- Learn each technology independently before exploring their integration
- Practice with hands-on examples throughout the learning journey

## How to Use This Book

- **Complete Book**: Progress through all modules sequentially for comprehensive understanding
- **Module-Specific**: Focus on specific modules relevant to your interests
- **Capstone Project**: Integrate all concepts in the autonomous humanoid project
